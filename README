rich_header.h is a simple and flexible header only C/C++ library for reading and
deciphering the undocumented rich header from the portable executable (PE)
files.

The header file by itself acts just like a header file and you have to explicitly
define the 'RICH_HEADER_IMPLEMENTATION' to also include the function definitions.

Getting started
===============

I've included a small example code (example.c) which basically includes all
the functions you need to get started with the library.

For more information just read the source or the function comments! it's really
simple.
